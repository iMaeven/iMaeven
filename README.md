Heya there, I'm Maeven, hailing from The City of Angels, and I'm an enthusiast for music, especially anything with guitars. I'm currently studying at UCLA to pursue a Computer Science & Music Composition major.

I have a diverse tech stack, having experience with Scala, Nim, Type/JavaScript, Crystal, C/++, and Elixir, and I'm currently learning Ada and Haskell. I'm always up for trying new things because I love the learning process.
